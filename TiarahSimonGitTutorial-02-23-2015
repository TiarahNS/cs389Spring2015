Part 4
•	Repository – this is a directory initialized by Github where version controlling of files begins. 
•	Commit – this is a snapshot of the repository showing all changes that have been made by all to the repository.
•	Push – this command tells Git where to put your commits.
•	Branch – this is a copy of the developer’s code where separate commits could be made when fixing bugs before merging back into the main branch.
•	Fork – this is a copy of a repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the original.
•	Merge – copying changes from the branch you’ve created to the master branch.
•	Clone – this command copies a git repository.
•	Pull – this command fetches new data from a remote repository and merges in into the current branch.
•	Pull Request – this enables the project leader review changes and makes comments before merging in the changes.
